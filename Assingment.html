    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>

        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media</li><br>
        <li><span class="sagar">CSS is not necessary </span> <span class="dep">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can
            contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li class="nikhil">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol><br>
    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1><br>
    <ul type="disc" class="red">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external
            CSS files. however,<span class="himanshu">in this tutitorial we will use Inline
                and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier
            for you to try ityourself</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="saini">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on theother hand,applies a style to one unique
         element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript </h2>
<h6>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</h6>
<h4>There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</h4>
